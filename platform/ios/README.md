# HyperHLE for iOS

A native iOS app that runs the HyperHLE core on modern iPhones and iPads. It
plays supported 32-bit iPhone OS games through high-level emulation and the
Dynarmic JIT. No games or Apple software are included.

The iOS app, its build scripts and its packaging come from
[Applesauce](https://github.com/johnny901901901/Applesauce), an unaffiliated
iOS port of touchHLE and HyperHLE. This directory is that host app, rebranded
and built against this repository's core. Applesauce is not connected to this
fork, so report problems here rather than there.

## Downloads

Every run of the [HyperHLE CI workflow](https://github.com/KlugKlugTG/HyperHLE-Fork/actions/workflows/HyperHLE_release.yml)
uploads the three IPAs below as separate artifacts, and
[releases](https://github.com/KlugKlugTG/HyperHLE-Fork/releases) attach them
too:

| Your iOS | IPA | How JIT gets enabled |
| --- | --- | --- |
| 17.4 or newer | `HyperHLE-iOS-unsigned.ipa` | Sideload (AltStore, SideStore, Sideloadly, Xcode), then StikDebug's bolt button in the app |
| 15.0–17.0, TrollStore installed | `HyperHLE-iOS-trollstore.ipa` | TrollStore's **Enable JIT**, before each session |
| 15.0–17.0, TrollStore, **A11 or older** | `HyperHLE-iOS-trollstore-permanent-jit.ipa` | Already on, and stays on |
| 17.0.1–17.3 | — | Only AltJIT with a computer attached |

The app's version follows the repository's release tags: a release build
carries that release's version (e.g. `1.1.0`), and other builds carry the latest
tag's. The build number is the commit count.

- The plain IPA is fully unsigned. Your install tool signs it with your own
  Apple account.
- The TrollStore IPAs are fakesigned with `ldid` so they can carry
  `get-task-allow` and the extended-virtual-addressing and
  increased-memory-limit entitlements. A free Apple account cannot sign those.
- **The permanent-JIT build crashes on launch on A12 and newer** (iPhone XS/XR
  onwards), because iOS bans `dynamic-codesigning` there. Use the ordinary
  TrollStore build on those devices.

## JIT

Dynarmic needs executable memory, so JIT has to be enabled whenever the app
starts as a new process:

- **StikDebug (iOS 17.4+):** pair StikDebug with your device, connect its
  loopback VPN, then tap the bolt button in the HyperHLE library.
- **TrollStore (iOS 15.0–17.0):** use TrollStore's **Enable JIT** on HyperHLE
  before starting a game.
- **AltJIT:** in AltStore, long-press HyperHLE under **My Apps** and choose
  **Enable JIT**.

## Importing games

Tap **Import Game** and pick a decrypted 32-bit `.ipa` from Files. The app reads
its name and icon and adds it to the library. Saves and imported games live in
the app's Documents folder, which the Files app shows under **On My iPhone**.

Per-game options from `touchHLE_default_options.txt` apply as on other
platforms. On iOS, `--ios-es2-direct-present` additionally presents an OpenGL
ES 2.0 drawable directly even when it is not the fullscreen layer (The Sims
Medieval needs it).

## Building

Requirements: macOS with a recent Xcode, Rust via rustup, CMake, Ninja,
Python 3, Boost headers in `vendor/boost` (or `TOUCHHLE_BOOST_ROOT`), and
`ldid` for the TrollStore IPAs.

```sh
git submodule update --init
brew install cmake ninja ldid
rustup target add aarch64-apple-ios

sh platform/ios/scripts/build-sdl-shared.sh iphoneos
sh platform/ios/scripts/build-host.sh iphoneos Release

sh platform/ios/scripts/package-ipa.sh
sh platform/ios/scripts/package-ipa.sh --trollstore
sh platform/ios/scripts/package-ipa.sh --trollstore-permanent-jit
```

The IPAs land in `dist/`. Check them with `platform/ios/scripts/verify-ipa.sh`
(pass `--trollstore` or `--trollstore-permanent-jit` for those builds).

How the pieces fit together:

- The core is built from `platform/ios/rust-entry` as `libhyperhle_core.dylib`
  with the `dynamic-sdl` feature, and the app loads it with `dlopen`.
- SDL2 is built as a shared library both the app and the core link against.
  SDL's UIKit backend needs a few changes for this host
  (`patches/sdl-ios-host.patch`), applied to a copy of `vendor/SDL` in
  `build/sdl-ios-src`.
- Dynarmic needs the iOS JIT changes in `patches/dynarmic-ios-jit.patch`.
  These choose how to get executable memory when a game starts: from an
  attached debugger via `brk #0xf00d` (StikDebug on iOS 26+), by switching
  memory between writable and executable when the app is merely "debugged"
  (TrollStore's Enable JIT, AltJIT, StikDebug before iOS 26), or as a `MAP_JIT`
  region (permanent JIT). They are
  applied to a copy of `vendor/dynarmic` in `build/dynarmic-ios-src`, which the
  build points at through `TOUCHHLE_DYNARMIC_DIR`. The submodules themselves
  are never modified.

To run on your own device from Xcode, run `build-sdl-shared.sh iphoneos` and
`build-rust.sh aarch64-apple-ios Debug`, open `TouchHLEHost.xcodeproj`, choose
your team under **Signing & Capabilities** (and change the bundle identifier in
`Config/Build.xcconfig` if needed), then press **Run**.

The host can also ship upstream touchHLE as a second core. Point
`TOUCHHLE_CORE_REPO` at a touchHLE checkout that has an iOS entry crate (such as
the `ios-core-dylib` branch of johnny901901901/touchHLE) when running
`build-host.sh`, and the in-app core picker appears.
